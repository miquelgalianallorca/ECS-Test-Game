// System/Component ideas
//------------------------------------------------------------------
- Movement System (use this both for characters and the camera)
	- input component: detect input, enabled
		- input could be disabled by UI (ie. pause menu)
		- input only enabled for currently controlled character
	- AI component: behaviour (generates input), enabled
		- NPCs have AI instead of input
		- Non-controlled characters enable their AI outside of combat (follow behaviour)
		- Disabled out of turn in combat
	- movement component: movement speed, enabled
		- movement can be disabled by combat system (in combat, out of turn)
		- movement can be disabled by effects (frozen, dead)
	- transform component: position, rotation
		- move base on input (speed = distance/time)
	- collider component: speed, collider shape
		- don't move if after the move we would be colliding
	- turn component: how much we've moved this turn
	- character stats component: how much we can move per turn (speed attribute?)

- Turn Combat System (keep a list of turn components - track turn order - update turn component on entities)
	- input component: detect input, enabled
		- key to end turn
	- AI component: enabled
	- turn component: active (bool set if it's the entity's current turn)
	- character stats component: bonus 
	+ StartCombat(): generate turn order
	+ bool NextTurn(): disable turn component of current turn haver, enable turn component of next one
		- return if there are no next turns, to end combat
	+ OnCombatEnd(): return components to their default state, remove turn combat system

- Render System
	- transform component: position, rotation
	- shape component (draw based on shape data)
	- collider component: speed
		- use the current speed to interpolate the drawing position


- UI

1) Main character portraits
	- click to select and control (if not in combat)
	- highlight actor on hover
2) Initiative order (in combat)
	- marker for whose turn it is
3) Skill bar
	- 6 icons?
	- Show health/energy under bar?
	- Show hints on skill hover?
	- last skill is "pass" to end turn


"actor component"
	- health, speed
	- skills?
	- isPlayer? (only one party NPC starts as player)
	- isPartyNPC? (add to UI on entity created)
	- isEnemy? (add to AI on entity created)
	- ...

"effect" components
	- other stuff (water, fire)
	- damage over time
	- movement slowing
	- instant death
	- ...

"gamerules"
	- victory conditions?
	- getting somewhere? time limit? kill X enemies?
	- ...
