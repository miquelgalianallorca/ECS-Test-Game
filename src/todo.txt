// System/Component ideas
//------------------------------------------------------------------
- Movement System (use this both for characters and the camera)
	- input component: detect input, enabled
		- input could be disabled by UI (ie. pause menu)
		- input only enabled for currently controlled character
	- AI component: behaviour (generates input), enabled
		- NPCs have AI instead of input
		- Non-controlled characters enable their AI outside of combat (follow behaviour)
		- Disabled out of turn in combat
	- movement component: movement speed, enabled
		- movement can be disabled by combat system (in combat, out of turn)
		- movement can be disabled by effects (frozen, dead)
	- transform component: position, rotation
		- move base on input (speed = distance/time)
	- collider component: speed, collider shape
		- don't move if after the move we would be colliding
	- turn component: how much we've moved this turn
	- character stats component: how much we can move per turn (speed attribute?)
